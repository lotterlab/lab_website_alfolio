We are an interdisciplinary group with two core research aims: 1) developing more robust computer vision algorithms using insights from human vision, and 2) optimizing these algorithms for medical imaging to deliver real-world impact. We aim to realize this impact through collaborative research along the full clinical application pipeline - from algorithm development to the science of clinical integration itself.
