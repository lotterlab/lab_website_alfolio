The ease with which the human brain makes sense of the visual world can make one fail to appreciate the true computational complexity of real-world vision. Instilling these abilities in machines holds a promise of widespread societal benefit through applications ranging from self-driving cars to the automated interpretation of medical images. However, despite tremendous recent progress, state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms still pale in comparison to their human counterparts in mission-critical dimensions such as robustness, learning from few labeled examples, and generalization to new scenarios. Nonetheless, in-silico neural networks are far more amenable to simulation and inspection than their in-vivo analogs, thus offering opportunities to advance our understanding of biological neuronal systems.

Our research leverages the symbiosis between brains and machines to develop computer vision algorithms that work in the real world and, reciprocally, elucidate principles of high-level biological vision using computer vision models. In developing AI guided by biological insights, we focus on applications in medical imaging, as this domain epitomizes todayâ€™s challenges in AI and offers high potential for tangible impact. We aim to realize this impact through collaborative research along the full clinical AI pipeline - from algorithm development to the science of clinical integration itself.<br/>
